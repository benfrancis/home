A home screen for your home

## Get Started
Make sure that you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

To get started hacking, simply clone the home repository from GitHub and run the server.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/webianproject/home.git
$ cd home
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Load ```http://localhost:8080``` in your web browser or use it with [Webian Shell](https://github.com/webianproject/shell).
